## Report Model Version and Date

It is also crucial for all types of studies to document the specific version of the LLM used in the study, along with the date when the experiments were conducted. LLMs are frequently updated, and different versions may produce varying results. 
By providing this information, researchers enable others to reproduce the study under the same conditions. Different model providers have varying degrees of information. For example, OpenAI provides a model version and a system fingerprint describing the backend configuration that can also influence the output. Therefore, stating "We used gpt-4o-2024-08-0, system fingerprint fp_6b68a8204b" provides clarity on the [exact model and runtime environment](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/object).

### Recommendations per Study Type

**TODO:** Connect guideline to study types and for each type have bullet point lists with information that MUST, SHOULD, or MAY be reported (usage of those terms according to [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119)).
