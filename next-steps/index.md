# Next Steps

* Define inclusion and exclusion criteria for papers using LLMs, statistical language models, tranformer models, with/without generation, etc., maybe reuse criteria from [previous literature reviews](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3695988).
* Conduct a critical review of a stratified random sample of software engineering research papers published at ICSE, FSE, ASE, TSE, and TOSEM.
* Add final guidelines to [ACM SIGSOFT Empirical Standards](https://www2.sigsoft.org/EmpiricalStandards/docs/standards).
* Reach out to open science chairs and PC chairs to advertise guidelines.
* Reach out to [ReSA](https://www.researchsoft.org/).
