# Evaluation Guidelines for Empirical Studies involving LLMs
{: .fs-9 }

Towards community guidlines for empirical studies in software engineering involving LLMs.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

This website hosts a draft of community guidlines for empirical studies in software engineering involving LLMs.
We present a first taxonomy of [study types](/study-types) and corresponding [guidelines](/guidelines).

The current draft is based on a [position paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07668) as well as discussion during the [ISERN](https://isern.iese.de/) 2024 meeting and the 2nd [Copenhagen Symposium on Human-Centered Software Engineering AI](https://www.danielrusso.org/copenhagen-symposium-human-centered-ai-software-engineering/).
To contribute to the guidelines, you can open an issue or a pull request in [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/se-ubt/llm-guidelines).
